* VSD DAY 1

The goal of day 1 is to install openlane via the lab manual and familiarize with the tool.

** OpenLane 

Openlane is collaboration software the includes multiple opensource tools to automate the steps involed in RTL to GDSII flow. The openlane can be installed from [[https://github.com/The-OpenROAD-Project/OpenLane][GitHub]], this [[https://woset-workshop.github.io/PDFs/2020/a21.pdf][Paper]] discussing it two main uses case:
1. Harderning a macro 
2. Integrating a System-on-Chip (SoC).

For each design step in the ASIC design flow, an equivalent open source tool is utilized to accomplish the task. The open-source tool list for each design step is as follows according to [[https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Building-OpenLANE%3A-A-130nm-OpenROAD-based-Tapeout-%3A-Shalan-Edwards/512e49a704bb9f461a7ee12edd0639b29f8a4976][Paper]]:

From Figure 1, the OpenLane tool requires two categories of files: 
1. Design Files: These are the RTL files that are written by an RTL design engineer.
2. PDKs: A Process Design Kit (PDK) is a set of files used to model a fabrication process. Generally, the PDK files are degined by a foundary with a certain technology.

** Process Design Kit (PDK)
The OpenLane tools use PDKs from the SkyWater 130nm process. The complete documentation for SkyWater SKY130 PDK can be found [[https://skywater-pdk.readthedocs.io/en/main/index.html][here]].

The terminology used to identify SKY130 PDK is as follows:

<process name>_<library_source_abbreviation>_<library_type_abbreviation>[_library_name]

- Process name: is the name of the process technology and is always "sky130".

- Library source abbreviation: specifies the foundry source of the library. The table below shows the list of the library sources:
| Library source            | Library source abbreviation |
|---------------------------+-----------------------------|
| SkyWater                  | fd                          |
| Efabless                  | ef                          |
| Oklahoma State University | osu                         |

- Library type abbreviation: content found in the library, the table below shows the list of abbreviations:
  | Library type                   | Library type abbreviation |
  |--------------------------------+---------------------------|
  | Primitive cell                 | pr                        |
  | Digital Standard cell          | sc                        |
  | Build Space (flash, SRAM, etc) | bd                        |
  | IO and Periphery               | io                        |
  | Miscellaneous                  | xx                        |
  
- Library name: is the representation of the type of content found in the library.

- sky130_fd_sc_ls: SKY130 Low-Speed Digital Standard Cells
- sky130_fd_sc_ms: SKY130 Medium Speed Digital Standard Cells

From the name it can be seen that all the standard cell libraries are provided by SkyWater.

** Standard Cell Libraries
Digital Standard Cells can be found in a folder called "~/tools/openlane_working_dir/pdks/skywater-pdk/libraries/". Among the available standard cells let us look at a high density two input AND gate in the folder "sky130_fc_sc_hd/latest/cells".

** LAB 1: Run OpenLane

*** Task: Synthesize picorv32a design and find the flop ratio. 

1. Open a terminal in "~/Desktop/work/tools/openlane_working_dir/openlane" and excute "docker" and the "./flow.tcl -interactive" and add required packages. See the figure below for more information.

#+attr_html: :width 600px
[[./resources/openlane_resources/VSD_Day1_openlane.png]]


Picorv32a is a simple risc-v processor core present in the "design" dicrectory. Before synthesizing the design prep the design so that it links to all the tech file and lib files for the design to be synthesized.
2. Execute "prep -design picorv32a".


#+attr_html: : width 600px
[[./resources/openlane_resources/VSD_Day1_prep.png]]
3. Run synthesis by executing "run_synthesis"
[[./resources/openlane_resources/VSD_Day1_syn.png]]
The total number of cells is 14876 and the number of D-FF utilized is 1613, therefore, the flop ratio is 10.84%. 

* VSD DAY 2

The goal of day 2 is to understand floorplan.

** Utilization Factor and Aspect Ratio

Setting the width and height of the die is the first and most important step to understanding how many cells can fit in the die. Gate level netlist provides the necessary information regarding the connectivity of the design. The dimensions of the chips depend on the dimensions of the logic gates. Each gate is defined by the length and breadth of the gates. 

Utilization factor (UF) = Area occupied by netlist / Total area of the core.

Aspect Ratio (AR) =  height / width.

Suppose the height and width of a logic cell are 1 unit each, and the UF and AR are 1 sq unit or 100% utilization factor. Generally, 100% utilization factor is not advisable as there should be some space left for routing.

[[./resources/openlane_resources/die_core2.png]]



** Pre-Placed Cells

Cells that are used multiples are implemented once and can be reduced. Some of the cells that can be implemented once and reused multiple times are memory, clock-gating cells, comparators, etc. These cells must be placed in such a way they can be used multiple times by the design and are called pre-laced cells. The placement of these cells will be fixed and will be done before placing the logic. PnR tool will not optimize the placement of these cells.

*** De-coupling Capacitor 
De-coupling capacitors ensure the logic cells receive enough voltage so that the outputs lie within the noise margins. There will be a potential drop across the wire due to resistance and capacitance because the logic cell may not receive the full-scale voltage to function. If the voltage drop is below the noise margin then the cell will not turn on or turn off correctly. The de-coupling capacitor is placed close to the cell so that this capacitor will compensate for the voltage drop. These capacitors must be placed close to all the pre-placed cells to ensure full-scale voltage.

#+attr_html: : width 600px
[[./resources/openlane_resources/de_couple2.png]]



*** Power Planning

De-coupling capacitor takes care of all the pre-placed cells but what about logic cells? It is not feasible to place de-coupling capacitors around all the logic cells. It is important to place the VDD and VSS in such a way the distance between the logic cells and the voltage source is as minimal as possible. To achieve this the VDD and VSS metals are run throughout the chip with taps, and the logic cells receive power from the closest source. 

Ground bounce and voltage droop occur when a single voltage source is used for multiple logic cells. To avoid this multiple rails of VDD and VSS are used as shown in the figure below.

- floorplan 
| Variable          | Description                                                                                                                                                |
|-------------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `FP_CORE_UTIL`    | The core utilization percentage.<br>(Default:`50`percent)                                                                                                  |

| `FP_SIZING`       | Whether to use relative sizing by making use of `FP_CORE_UTIL` or absolute one using `DIE_AREA`. <br> (Default: `"relative"` - accepts "absolute" as well) |
| `DIE_AREA`        | Specific die area to be used in floorplanning. Specified as a 4-corner rectangle. Units in mm <br> (Default: unset)                                        |
| `FP_IO_HMETAL`    | The metal layer on which to place the io pins horizontally (top and bottom of the die). <br>(Default: `4`)                                                 |

3. The floorplan switches can be customized with the help of "~/Dekstop/work/tools/openlane_working_dir/openlane/configuration/floorplan.tcl" file. This will is will have some default parameters which can be changed. Apart from this file, there are two other files where the configurations can be set i.e., "config.tcl" and "sky130A_sky130_fd_sc_hd_config.tcl" located at "~/Desktop/work/tools/openlane_working_dir/openlane/designs/picorv32a". The latter file has the highest precedence over config.tcl and config.tcl has higher precedence over floorplan.tcl.

NOTE: In the openlane flow the vertical and horizontal metal has one metal layer more than what is specified in the configuration.

"sky130A_sky13_fd_sc_hd_config.tcl" is edited as follows as it has the highest precedence. In the file the aspect ratio is set to 0.5 and the core utilization is set to 55%.
#+begin_src tcl
# SCL Configs
set ::env(GLB_RT_ADJUSTMENT) 0.1

set ::env(SYNTH_MAX_FANOUT) 6
set ::env(CLOCK_PERIOD) "12.000"
set ::env(FP_CORE_UTIL) "55"
set ::env(FP_IO_VMETAL) "4"
set ::env(FP_IO_HMETAL) "3"
set ::env(FP_ASPECT_RATIO) "0.5"
set ::env(PL_TARGET_DENSITY) [ expr ($::env(FP_CORE_UTIL)+5) / 100.0 ]
#+end_src

4. Run floorplan with the command "run_floorplan".

The updated config.tcl is located in "~/Desktop/work/tools/openlane_worling_dir/openlane/designs/picorv32a/run/{date}/sky130A_sky130_fd_sc_hd_config.tcl". The {date} folder is the folder with the name as the date which the floorplan was run.

The updated floor_plan_config.tcl is shown below.

#+attr_html: : width 600px
[[./resources/openlane_resources/floor_plan_config.png]]


The aspect ratio is the ratio of height to width. Looking at "picorv32.floorplan.def" shown below shows the die area. The die is is reperesented in a cartesian coordinate system, therefore the length is 389.440-micron units and the width is 746.405-micron units. Hence, the aspect ratio is 389.440/746.405 = 0.5215 ~ 0.5 as we set in the TCL file.


#+attr_html: : width 600px
[[./resources/openlane_resources/die_area.png]]


The die image is shown below.


#+attr_html: : width 600px
[[./resources/openlane_resources/die.png]]


5. Open magic tool to see the floorplan. Go inside the folder "~/Desktop/work/tools/openlane_working_dir/openlane/designs/picorv32a/runs/{date_folder}/results/floorplan" and open terminal and execute the command "magic -T /home/${USER}/Desktop/work/tools/openlane_working_dir/pdks/sky130A/libs.tech/magic/sky130A.tech lef read ../../tmp/merged.lef def read picorv32a.floorplan.def".


#+attr_html: : width 600px
[[./resources/openlane_resources/magic.png]] 

Even here it can be seen the aspect ratio is 0.5.

6. The vertical and horizontal metal layer is set as 4 and 3 respectively. Let us ensure that the right metal is being used for horizontal and vertical metal.  



** Netlist binding with physical cells

Each component in the netlist is represented a box with a width and height. These blocks are present in the library with all the information regarding timing and area, and many more. Let's take an example of a netlist given in the figure below.


#+attr_html: : width 600px
[[.//resources/openlane_resources/netlist1.png]]


In reality, each cell is represented as a box and its information regarding delay and area is stored a library file. This library will consist of various versions of the same cell based on area and time as both are inversely proportional to each other. The figure below shows an example of the various versions of the cells for the netlist, based on the constraint certain cells will be picked from the library file.


#+attr_html: : width 600px
[[./resources/openlane_resources/netlist2.png]] 


Using the cells in the library the given netlist will be placed in the floorplan as shown in the figure below.


#+attr_html: : width 600px
[[./resources/openlane_resources/placement3.png]] 

It can be seen that the pre-paced cells are placed first and the logic is placed in the remaining area. It is important to place the cells in such a way that the delay is the least. The figure below shows the complete placement of the logic cells. Repeaters and buffers are added to ensure there is no loss of data but adding them increases area. Careful consideration must be conducted in placing the cells.


#+attr_html: : width 600px
[[./resources/openlane_resources/placement4.png]]i


The placement of the logic cells must be optimized to produce the least delay and area.


#+attr_html: : width 600px
[[./resources/openlane_resources/placement5.png]]


** LAB Cont..

7. Congestion related placement. Execute "run_placement" to run placement, global placement occurs with this command.HPWL = Half parameter wire length. reduction of HPWL is the main focus.

8. Open the magic tool to see the placement. Go inside the folder "~/Desktop/work/tools/openlane_working_dir/openlane/designs/picorv32a/runs/{date_folder}/results/placement" and open terminal and execute the command "magic -T /home/${USER}/Desktop/work/tools/openlane_working_dir/pdks/sky130A/libs.tech/magic/sky130A.tech lef read ../../tmp/merged.lef def read picorv32a.placement.def".

** Characterization Design Flow


Describe 8 different steps. 

GUNA software.

Characterization design flow includes eight important  steps to analyze and model an electrical component based on the standard cell library files.

1. Technology library and setup environment: Technology libraries such 5nm, 7nm, 14nm, etc are chosen for the fabrication process. Tools such as cadence, Synopsys, or mentor graphics are decided to design the environment. 
2. Cell definition: standard cells are defined along with the performance metrics.
3. Pre-characterization: SPICE models and the testbenches for cells are chosen.
4. Simulation and data collection: the design is simulated for functionality and analysis such as DC, and Transient is applied to the design models.
5. Data Analysis: timing parameters are extracted and power measurements are evaluated at various operation conditions.
6. Library Generation: .lib and .lef files are generated.
7. Validation and Verification: the design is tested against various tools and libraries to confirm the consistent functionality.
8. Optimization: Optimized for power, area and delay.


* VSD Day 3

** Changing design considerations on the fly.

Reset the variables and run the design again. Use the command "$set {varible}". For example to change the pin alignment from equidistant to stacked use => "set ::env(FP_IO_MODE) 2" and run floorplan again or any runs that are desired.


** SPICE Simulations

Need to create a spice deck for the simulation, in other words, its a netlist for spice simulation.

*** SPICE Deck Creation

- Component Connectivity: connection information of pmos and nmos, input and output, VDD and VSS. It is important to define the connectivity of the substrate as well.
- Component Values: define width/length of mos components, input load capacitance, and output load capacitance.
- Identify node: a node is point where a component is connected to both ends. One component will be presented between two nodes.

** Spice extraction and post-layout spice simulation for Inverter Cell

Download the necessary files for the lab, these files provide the inverter cell.

*** Download Files for CMOS Inverter for ngspice simulations

Got to the location "~/Desktop/work/tools/openlane_working_dir/openlane" and clone the project from https://github.com/nickson-jose/vsdstdcelldesign.

*** Copy the Magic tech to open the design. 

Copy the tech file to the vsdcelldesign location. Follow the command to copy the design.

$cp ~/Desktop/work/tools/openlane_working_dir/pdks/sky130A/lib.tech/magic/sky130A.tech ~/Desktop/work/tools/openlane_working_dir/openlane/vsdstdcelldesign/sky130A.tech

*** Open the design

From the design location invoke magic by executing $magic -T sky130A.tech sky130_inv.mag &.

** Extract the spice model

From the tkcon window, ensure you in the design location i.e., vsdcelldesign, perfom the following steps:

1. Create an extraction file by using the command "extract all" for simulation in ngspice, "sky130_inv.ext" will be generated in the location of the design.
2. From tkcon execute "ext2spice cthresh 0 rthresh 0" along with the parasitic capacitance.  
3. Then execute "exttospice" from the tk con window, sky130A_inv.spice will be generated with the spice deck.

** Run Spice model


1. From the design location execute $ngspice sky130_inv.spice. The image shown below should be seen.

* VSD DAY 4

Goal: Extract the .lef from the inverter and use it for the design picorv32a.


** Step 1: Extract the .lef file
Guidelines for extractions:
1. Ports should be on the intersection of the vertical and horizontal tracks.
2. The width of the standard cell must be an odd multiple of the horizontal track pitch.
3. The height of the standard cell must be an even multiple of the vertical tracks.

Tracks info can be found in "~Desktop/works/tools/openlane_working_dir/sky130A/libs.tech/openlane/sky130fd_fd_sc_hd/tracks.info". The tracks info is specified below.

#+begin_src 
li1 X 0.23 0.46
li1 Y 0.17 0.34
met1 X 0.17 0.34
met1 Y 0.17 0.34
met2 X 0.23 0.46
met2 Y 0.23 0.46
met3 X 0.34 0.68
met3 Y 0.34 0.68
met4 X 0.46 0.92
met4 Y 0.46 0.92
met5 X 1.70 3.40
met5 Y 1.70 3.40
#+end_src


Invoke magic from the "vsddesigncell" folder with the "magic -T sky130.tech sky130_inv.mag &". In the tkcon widown specify the grid values using the tracks info => "grid 0.46um 0.34um 0.23um 0.17um". Now the inverter design should look like below.


#+attr_html: : width 600px

[[./resources/openlane_resources/inv2.png]]

In the tkcon window:

Save the design with a new name "save sky130_vsdinv.mag". Open the newly saved design using magic and extract the lef by using  "lef write". Copy the lef file to the source folder of the picorv32a. 

** Step 2: Include the lef file in the open lane flow

- Ensure the newly generated .lef file is present in the src folder of the pircorv32a.
- Add the necessary changes to the config file to include the newly generated lef file and its libraries. The updated config. file for the picorv32a should look like below:

#+begin_src 
# Design
set ::env(DESIGN_NAME) "picorv32a"

set ::env(VERILOG_FILES) "./designs/picorv32a/src/picorv32a.v"
set ::env(SDC_FILE) "./designs/picorv32a/src/picorv32a.sdc"

set ::env(CLOCK_PERIOD) "12.000"
set ::env(CLOCK_PORT) "clk"

set ::env(FP_CORE_UTIL) "30"
set ::env(FP_IO_VMETAL) "4"
set ::env(FP_IO_HMETAL) "3"


set ::env(CLOCK_NET) $::env(CLOCK_PORT)


set ::env(LIB_SYNTH) "$::env(OPENLANE_ROOT)/designs/picorv32a/src/sky130_fd_sc_hd__typical.lib"
set ::env(LIB_FASTEST) "$::env(OPENLANE_ROOT)/designs/picorv32a/src/sky130_fd_sc_hd__fast.lib"
set ::env(LIB_SLOWEST) "$::env(OPENLANE_ROOT)/designs/picorv32a/src/sky130_fd_sc_hd__slow.lib"
set ::env(LIB_TYPICAL) "$::env(OPENLANE_ROOT)/designs/picorv32a/src/sky130_fd_sc_hd__typical.lib"

set ::env(EXTRA_LEFS) [glob $::env(OPENLANE_ROOT)/designs/$::env(DESIGN_NAME)/src/*.lef]



set filename $::env(OPENLANE_ROOT)/designs/$::env(DESIGN_NAME)/$::env(PDK)_$::env(STD_CELL_LIBRARY)_config.tcl
if { [file exists $filename] == 1} {
	source $filename
}
#+end_src

- Run synthesis.
#+begin_src 

docker
./flow.tcl -interactive
package require openlane 0.9
prep -design picorv32a

set lefs [glob $::env(DESIGN_DIR)/src/*.lef]
add_lefs -src $lefs

run_synthesis

#+end_src


- Synthesis results are shown below where the extracted inv is used about 1537 times. 


#+attr_html: : width 600px
[[./resources/openlane_resources/syn_result1.png]]   

- Adding the new design leads to timing violations that need to be resolved.

#+attr_html: : width 600px
[[./resources/openlane_resources/vio1.png]]

*** Timing Solution

1. Change synthesis stratergy more favorable to timing that area using  "set ::env(SYNTH_STRATERGY) "DELAY 3" "
2. Change fan outs by using "set ::env(SYNTH_BUFFERING) 1". TO check whether it is on or not by using echo
2. Change sizing by using "set ::env(SYNTH_SIZING) 1"
4. Change the driving cell by using "set ::env(SYNTH_DRIVING_CELL)" 

Use the following commands to improve timing:

#+begin_src 
# overwrite the same design using the following command
prep -design picorv32a -tag <folder_name> -overwrite

set lefs [glob $::env(DESIGN_DIR)/src/*.lef]
add_lefs -src $lefs

set ::env(SYNTH_STRATEGY) "DELAY 3"

set ::env(SYNTH_BUFFERING) 1

set ::env(SYNTH_SIZING) 1

run_synthesis

#+end_src

The improved timing is shown below but because of the configuration set the area is increased.
