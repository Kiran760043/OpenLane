* VSD DAY 1

The goal of day 1 is to install openlane via the lab manual and familiarize with the tool.

** OpenLane 

Openlane is collaboration software that includes multiple open-source tools to automate the steps involved in RTL to GDSII flow. The openlane can be installed from [[https://github.com/The-OpenROAD-Project/OpenLane][GitHub]], this [[https://woset-workshop.github.io/PDFs/2020/a21.pdf][Paper]] discussing it two main uses case:
1. Harderning a macro 
2. Integrating a System-on-Chip (SoC).

For each design step in the ASIC design flow, an equivalent open-source tool is utilized to accomplish the task. The open-source tool list for each design step is as follows according to [[https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Building-OpenLANE%3A-A-130nm-OpenROAD-based-Tapeout-%3A-Shalan-Edwards/512e49a704bb9f461a7ee12edd0639b29f8a4976][Paper]]:

From Figure 1, the OpenLane tool requires two categories of files: 
1. Design Files: These are the RTL files that are written by an RTL design engineer.
2. PDKs: A Process Design Kit (PDK) is a set of files used to model a fabrication process. Generally, the PDK files are defined by a foundry with a certain technology.

** Process Design Kit (PDK)
The OpenLane tools uses PDKs from SkyWater 130nm process. The complete documentation for SkyWater SKY130 PDK can be found [[https://skywater-pdk.readthedocs.io/en/main/index.html][here]].

The nomenclature used to identify SKY130 PDK is as follows:

<process name>_<library_source_abbreviation>_<library_type_abbreviation>[_library_name]

- Process name: is the name of the process technology and is always "sky130".

- Library source abbreviation specifies the library's foundry source. The table below shows the list of the library sources:
| Library source            | Library source abbreviation |
|---------------------------+-----------------------------|
| SkyWater                  | fd                          |
| Efabless                  | ef                          |
| Oklahoma State University | osu                         |

- Library type abbreviation: content found in the library, the table below shows the list of abbreviations:
  | Library type                   | Library type abbreviation |
  |--------------------------------+---------------------------|
  | Primitive cell                 | pr                        |
  | Digital Standard cell          | sc                        |
  | Build Space (flash, SRAM, etc) | bd                        |
  | IO and Peripheral              | io                        |
  | Miscellaneous                  | xx                        |
  
- Library name: is the representation of the type of content found in the library.

- sky130_fd_sc_hdll: SKY130 High-Density Low Leakage Digital Standard Cells

- sky130_fd_sc_ls: SKY130 Low-Speed Digital Standard Cells
- sky130_fd_sc_ms: SKY130 Medium Speed Digital Standard Cells

From the name, it can be seen that all the standard cell libraries are provided by SkyWater.

** Standard Cell Libraries
Digital Standard Cells can found in a folder called "~/tools/openlane_working_dir/pdks/skywater-pdk/libraries/". Among the available standard cells let us look at a high density two input AND gate in the folder "sky130_fc_sc_hd/latest/cells".

*** Task: Synthesize picorv32a design and find the flop ratio. 

1. Open a terminal in "~/Desktop/work/tools/openlane_working_dir/openlane" and excute "docker" and the "./flow.tcl -interactive" and add required packages. See the figure below for more information.

Picorv32a is a simple risc-v processor core present in the "design" directory. Before synthesizing the design prep the design so that it links to all the tech file and lib files for the design to be synthesized.
2. Execute "prep -design picorv32a".
[[./resources/VSD_Day1_prep.png]]3. Run synthesis by executing "run_synthesis"
[[./resources/VSD_Day1_syn.png]]
The total number of cells is 14876 and the number of D-FF utilized is 1613, therefore, the flop ratio is 10.84%.
